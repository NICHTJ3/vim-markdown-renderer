# Vim Markdown Preview

## What is this
This app is a vim based markdown pre-viewer using
react-codemirror as a text editor and react-markdown
for previews.

## Why
Pretty much I was sick of installing things just to preview markdown and wanted my vim keybindings

## Running the site locally
To run this app locally
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NICHTJ3/mardown-renderer
cd markdown-renderer
npm i
npm run start
```
